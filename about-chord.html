        <h2>What is a Chord?</h2>
        <p>A chord is a harmonic unit in music theory, consisting of three or more notes played simultaneously. Chords
            form the foundation of harmony in music and are essential for composition, performance, and analysis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chord-section">
        <h2>Chord Notation</h2>
        <p>Chords are typically notated using chord symbols, such as C (C major), Cm (C minor), C7 (C dominant seventh),
            etc. These symbols provide a quick way to represent harmonic structures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chord-section">
        <h2>Triads</h2>
        <p>Triads are three-note chords consisting of a root, third, and fifth. The four main types are major, minor,
            diminished, and augmented triads.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chord-section">
        <h2>Seventh Chords</h2>
        <p>Seventh chords add a fourth note to triads, creating richer harmonic textures. Common types include major
            seventh, minor seventh, and dominant seventh chords.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chord-section">
        <h2>Altered Chords</h2>
        <p>Altered chords modify standard chord structures by raising or lowering certain intervals, creating unique
            harmonic colors. Examples include augmented, diminished, and suspended chords.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chord-section">
        <h2>Inversions</h2>
        <p>Chord inversions rearrange the order of notes within a chord, placing notes other than the root in the bass.
            This technique adds variety to harmonic progressions.</p>
